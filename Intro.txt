                 You are in an Empire ship. Find Princess Leia's 
        recording and slip away. Watch out for Lord Vather on board! Good luck!

                After a long journey, you've met the Empire 
                          Destroyer on your way.
                You managed to get inside by stunning the sentries. 
        In a moment someone will probably find them, so avoid the enemy. 
                     You are in the fleet general's room.
